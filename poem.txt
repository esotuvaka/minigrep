In the fields of green and gold,
Where the sun's warm embrace takes hold,
And the flowers dance to the wind's gentle fold,
Lies a story waiting to be told.

Of a time long past and far away,
When dragons ruled the skies in play,
And knights would ride to save the day,
And wizards cast their spells in sway.

But now the world is much more tame,
The dragons gone, the knights the same,
And wizards now just a whispered name,
In a world where science reigns supreme.

Yet still the magic lingers on,
In the rustling of leaves, the break of dawn,
In the laughter of children, in the love that's born,
In the beauty of nature, we are forever drawn.

So let us cherish all that we hold dear,
And let the magic of life always be near,
For in this world, there's nothing to fear,
When love and kindness are always here.
